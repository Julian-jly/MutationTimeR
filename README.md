# MutationTime.R
MutationTime.R is an R script to time somatic mutations relative to clonal and subclonal copy number states and calculate
the relative timing of copy number gains.
It has been used by the PCAWG consortium to calculate mutation times of 2,778 whole genome sequencing samples. http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/161562
